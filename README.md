The excellent [Pdftk library](http://www.pdflabs.com/docs/build-pdftk/) does not seem to be actively maintained as of early 2012, hence this unofficial fork that fixes a few bugs.

It is quite hard work to build Pdftk from source on OS X, so Iâ€™ll maintain a binary installer for OS X as well.

Bug reports and especially pull requests are welcome.
