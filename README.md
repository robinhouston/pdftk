The excellent [Pdftk toolkit](http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) is only rarely updated, and the upstream maintainer has been unresponsive to email for at least a year, hence this repository that collects together a few bug fixes and other small improvements.

The code here is based on Pdftk 1.45, which was released in December 2012.

Since it is awkward to build Pdftk from source on OS X, we also maintain a [binary installer package for OS X](https://github.com/robinhouston/pdftk/raw/osx-package/osx_package/pdftk.pkg).
